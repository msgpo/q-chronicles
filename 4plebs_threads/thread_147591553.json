Our Army assisted in the massacre of 10,000s dissidents. The South was rolling their tanks around North of the border in 1950, after Truman weirdly pulled 100% of troops from the South (a green light to invade, for the North). So, Truman might have been the one to start the Korean War.\nOur troops conquered all of North Korea, until China sent its troops in to take it back.\n\nWe fought tooth and nail until settling back at the original border. 80% of North Korean urban areas were destroyed by American bombs. 3 million dead. After the war, Kim family executed a cadre of China loyalists.\n\nCould be CIA made stay-behind units in the North to maintain power there. Let it be a buffer proxy.\n\nMakes sense if you consider Vietnam: it was held up as helping the \u0022free South\u0022 in a war against the North. But actually, the entire South Vietnamese nation was fake, a product of American military invasion and occupation of the country.\n\nIn other words, (((policy makers))) of the era had a hard on for this whole North\/South kind of geopolitical wedge concept.
