must be completed to engage MI over other (3) letter agencies\nDuring the 1950s and 60s, federal troops and federalized National\nGuard forces, accompanied by military intelligence personnel, were\ndeployed to help integrate Southern schools23 and to help deal with\ncivil disorders in Detroit in 1967 and other cities the following year\nafter the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.24 Throughout\nthis period military intelligence units also continued to collect data on\nAmericans at home who were suspected of involvement in subversive\nactivities.25 In the late 1960s, the Pentagon compiled personal\ninformation on more than 100,000 politically active Americans in an\neffort to quell civil rights and anti-Vietnam War demonstrations and\nto discredit protestors.26 The Army used 1,500 plainclothes agents to\nwatch demonstrations, infiltrate organizations, and spread\ndisinformation. 2\n\u0027 According to one report, the Army had at least one\nobserver at every demonstration of more than twenty people.28\nThe Army\u0027s activities were summed up by Senator Sam Ervin:\nAllegedly for the purpose of predicting and preventing\ncivil disturbances which might develop beyond the control of\nstate and local officials, Army agents were sent throughout\nthe country to keep surveillance over the way the civilian\npopulation expressed their sentiments about government\npolicies.
